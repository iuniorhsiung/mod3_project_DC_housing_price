From these findings, we will reconfigure and group the Washington DC regions according to various housing statistics. Upon reconfiguration, these regions will then show similar/same sale prices and other housing characteristics. This analysis will be the basis of future evaluation including building predictive models to predict future home sale price and other notable housing market variables."

    "In the above chart, we can see a brief overview of our Washington DC housing market data that we gathered from Redfin. After some examination of the variables within this dataset, we wanted to narrow our testing down to only a few of the variables that we deemed most important for our future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important variable to us is Median Sale Price, as the main goal of our analysis and testing is to be able to eventually build predictive models that predict future home sale price. We determined that we will use Median Sale Price in our testing. Additionally, we decided to use Homes Sold Month-over-Month and Inventory Month-over-Month as the other two variables for our testing. We believe these two variables can not only have predictive power of future home sale price, but can also hold up well on their own if we used them as response variables in other models.\n",

    "We noticed that in our initial data chart that the notation of some numbers in some of the columns (including '$', 'K', ',', and '%') would potentially give us issues with coding. We removed that kind of notation from our data and can confirm in our above chart that the cleaning worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want to confirm that our previous code worked in converting all of our variables that were listed as a \"non-null object\" (besides Region and Month of Period End) to floats or integers that we can work with in our testing. The 'info' code shows that our variable conversions were indeed successful and the data is able to be worked with."
